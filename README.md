# tf-capstone-dnn
As of now, the file 'gamehints_tflearn_model.py' is the model working. The one labeled with 'tensorflow' is a work in progress. 
In order to get the tflearn model running right now:

1) Make sure your dataset is within the same folder as the 'gamehints_tflearn_model.py' python script.
2) Make sure the training dataset is of the same folder structure as digits (The images are within a subfolder that is its cooresponding classification label.
3) Create an additional folder called './Validation_Set' which contains your validation  set with the same folder structure as your training images.
4) open a terminal and run the 'gamehints_tflearn_model.py' script.

Let me know if you want to try it out and I can provide you with the datasets im working with.

Currently trying to code the classifier script so we can load the model and input an image and get our results.
